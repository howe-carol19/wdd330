<h1> Further Actions </h1> 

<h1> Function Properties and Methods </h1>

<p> Functions are first class objects because they can have properties and methods. </p>

<p>  the call() method can set the value of this inside the function to an object that is provided as the first argument..  </p>

<h2>Memoization</h2>
<p>There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript</p>>

<h3>Test</h3>
<p>A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization. If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can 
    save the result in a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.</p>
<h2> Temporary Variables</h2>

<p>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared. If a variable is only required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available later 
    in the code. Even worse, the name of the variable may clash with another piece of code (an external JavaScript library, for example) resulting in errors. Placing any code 
    that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. </p>


<h1>AJAX</h1>

<p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent 
    and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</p>
<h1>Clients and Servers </h1>
<p>The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) 
    from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.</p>
<p> Consequently, a server is required when requesting resources using Ajax. Typically this involves using a server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js, or .NET to serve the 
    data response following an Ajax request (usually from a back-end database). To practice using Ajax, you can either set up a local development server on your own computer, or 
    request the files from an external website that uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in order to avoid the same-origin policy that browsers enforce. All the examples in 
    this chapter can be run without having to set up a local development server, although it may be worth looking into if you wish to do a lot of Ajax or server-side development.</p>

<p> The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. </p>
<p> The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL.</p>
