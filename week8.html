<h1> TRANSFORM PROPERTY </h1> 

<h1> Function Properties and Methods </h1>

<p> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew 
    any element on the page. While some of these effects were possible using previously existing 
    CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives you 
    unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance. <br>
    Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These 
    functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left , 
    moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation 
    function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike position: relative , 
    which allows you to position an element either against its current position or against a parent or other 
    ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.
</p>



<h2>SCALING</h2>
<p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, 
    growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) 
    would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. </p>>

<h3>ROTATION</h3>
<p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale , by default the point of origin is the element’s center. 
    Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided 
    in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.</p>
    <p>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</p>

    <h2> CANVAS</h2>

<p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images 
    off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video. 
    We’ll start by introducing some of the basic drawing features of canvas, but then move on to using its power to transform our video—taking our modern-looking color video and converting it 
    into conventional black and white to match the overall look and feel ofThe HTML5 Herald. </p>


<h1>Variations on fillStyle</h1>

<p>Instead of a color as our fillStyle , we could have used a CanvasGradient or a CanvasPattern object. Let’s create a pattern on the second canvas element (whose ID is demo2 ) on the canvas.html page.
We create a CanvasPattern by calling the createPattern method. createPattern takes two parameters: the image to create the pattern with, and how that image should be repeated. The repeat value 
is a string, and the valid values are the same as those in CSS: repeat , repeat-x , repeat-y , and no-repeat .</p>


    <h1>Canvas versus SVG </h1>
<p> First, a quick refresher: SVG stands forScalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that,
     unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas,
      including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. There are also very useful open-source tools relevant to SVG, some of which we’ll leverage in order to add a spinning progress indicator to 
      The HTML5 Herald’s geolocation widget. </p>>
