<h1> FORMS </h1> 

<p> Made up of a form element that contains form controls. </p>

<h2> Form properties and methods </h2>

<p>Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods taht can be used to interact with the form. The form.submit() will submit the form automatically.
The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the html. The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form  so it sends to a different URL to be processed by the server.  </p>





<h1> FORM EVENTS </h1>

<p>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of inour this is when the cursor is placed inside the element. </p>

<p> const input = form.elements.searchInput;
input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false); </p>


<h2>Submitting a form </h2>

<p>The most important event is when we submit the form. The content of the form wi sent tothe server to be processed.
We can use JavaScript to intercept the form before itâ€™s sent by adding a submit event listener. Add the following code to the main.js file: </p>

<p>const form = document.forms['search']; <br> 
form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false); <br>
function search() { <br>
    alert(' Form Submitted'); } <br>  </p>


<h2> Retrieving and changing values from a  form. </h2>

<p>We can use this to report back what the user has searched for. Edit the search() function to the following: </p>

<h3>Form Controls </h3>
<p> In our previous search example, we only used the input and button form controls. But there are others that can help to make our web pages more interactive.
Some common types of form control are: </p>
    
 <p> INPUT fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads
 SELECT menus for drop-down lists of options
 TEXTAREA elements for longer text entry
 BUTTON elements for submitting and resetting forms </p>
