<h1> ERRORS, EXCEPTIONS, AND WARNINGS </h1> 

<p> Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>System error  </li>
        <li>Programmer error  </li>
        <li>User error  </li>
</ul>


<p> EXCEPTIONS: An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </p>


<h1> WARNINGS </h1>

<p> A warning can occur if thereâ€™s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program 
    will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning 
    may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.</p>

<p>  Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. 
    They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style 
    conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. </p>


<h2>ERROR OBJECTS</h2>

<ul>
    <li>EvalError</li>
    <li>RangeError</li>
    <li>SyntaxError</li>
    <li>TypeError</li>
    <li>URIError</li>
    <li>InternalError</li>

</ul>

<h3>Test</h3>
<p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. 
    Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, 
    and any errors will be identified early on.</p>
