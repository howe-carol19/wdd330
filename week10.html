<h1> Client-side form validation </h1>

<p> Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid 
    data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable 
    delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
</p>



<h2>Form validation</h2>
<p>This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data 
    is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called 
    client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are 
    focusing on client-side validation..</p>>



<h3>Length </h3>
<p>You can constrain the character length of all text fields created by <input> or <textarea> by using the minlength and
     maxlength attributes. A field is invalid if it has a value and that value has fewer characters than the minlength value 
     or more than the maxlength value.</p>
