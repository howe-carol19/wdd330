        Arrays
        An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair of square brackets:
        const myArray = [];

    </p>
    
    <p>
        Creating Array Literals
        We can create an array literal using square brackets that already contain some initial values, so there’s no need to add each value one by one. Here's an example:
        const avengers = ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk'];

    </p>
    
    <p>
        We start with 0.

        Removing Values from Arrays
        The delete operator will remove an item from an array:
        delete avengers[3];

    </p>

    Array Properties and Methods
    Arrays are a powerful weapon in a JavaScript ninja’s toolkit and have some useful methods. To demonstrate these, we’re going to use the following avengers array that is similar to the one we produced earlier.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Pop, Push, Shift, and Unshift
    To remove the last item from an array, we can use the pop() method:
    avengers.pop();
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The method returns the last item of the array, but the array no longer contains that item. 
        Merging Arrays
        Note that this does not change the avengers array, it simply creates another array combining the two arrays. 
        Use let and const so it is a local scope.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

        Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
