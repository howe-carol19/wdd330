    <h1> Week 3 </h1>
    
    <h2>OBJECT METHOD: this </h2>

    <p>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
        Methods allow objects to act.
        Methods can reference the object as this. </p>
    
    
    
    <h2> OBJECTS</h2> 
    <p> An object is a set of related values and functions. If a property is a function it will be called a METHOD.
        An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces.</p>
    
    <p> Create an object by entering a pair of curly braces. Don't use constructor function.</p>

       <li> superman.name</li>

       <li> superman[‘name’]</li>
     </ul>
    
    
    <p> superman["real" + " " + "name"] // the property is built using string concatenation
        "Clark Kent" </p>
    
    <p>To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket.
        superman.fly()
        superman['fly']() </p>
