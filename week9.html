<h1> The data- attribute </h1>

<p> The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes
    that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended 
    to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript 
    program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that 
    the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.
</p>



<h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
<p>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, 
    such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, 
    and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features 
    that appear in the latest devices. </p>>

<h3>WEB STORAGE</h3>
<p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to 
    using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. 
    This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific 
    information that can then be used during future sessions.</p>
    
    <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage , 
        which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. The information is 
        saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. There is also a sessionStorage
         object that works in the same way, although the data is only saved for the current session.</p>

<h2> GEOLOCATION</h2>

<p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. 
    This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed 
    at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or 
    speed and direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your 
    location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first. </p>


<h1>THE WINDOW OBJECT</h1>

<p> Every JavaScript environment has aglobal object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually 
    properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the 
    window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>


    <h1>Canvas versus SVG </h1>
<p> The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about 
    the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though, 
    this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been 
    visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, 
    if you’re into annoying your users.</p>

   <p>There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties and methods that are supported 
    by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto standard. These properties and methods are made available through 
    the window object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object. </p>
